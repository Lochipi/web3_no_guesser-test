# Game: Number gase.

This is a simple and interactive Number Guesser game built with **React**, **Vite**, **TypeScript**, and **Ant Design**. 
This game generates a random number between `1` and `100`, and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number. The application provides feedback on each guess, indicating whether the guess is `too high`, `too low`, or `correct`. If the player guesses the secret number within the allowed attempts, **they win the game**; otherwise, **they lose**.

## Key Features:
- **Random Number Generation**: Generates a secret number between 1 and 100.
- **User Input**: Allows the player to input their guesses.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.**
- **Win/Loss Condition**: Determines if the player has won or lost the game based on their guesses.
- **Limited Attempts:** Limits the number of attempts the player can make.
- **Interactive UI:** Utilizes Ant Design components for a clean and responsive user interface.

## Tech stack used:
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: As the build tool and development server.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and improved developer experience.
- **Ant Design**: For UI components and styling.


## Testing
I have used **Vitest** and **React Testing Library** for testing the components and logic of the application.
